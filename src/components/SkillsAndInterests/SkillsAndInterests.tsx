    they use your app over another? What steps do they need to go through to accomplish something? 
    That's why I love delving into this area to find techniques to spotting pain points

      and using whatever tech stack you so desire, but also the rapid pace of new tools/libraries to
      try out and the continuously changing the toolbox a developer has at their disposal.
      For example, Angular, React, and Vue have been influential in just the past decade.`,

    Similar to how user feedback drives the evolution of UIs, machine learning is a powerful tool to help us 
    to turn this data into smarter, optimized decisions. It's also an area that's constantly evolving and that's 
    why I enjoy delving into it from time to time (plus it's a perfect excuse to use Python again üêç).`,
